          On this Rose Day, each petal symbolizes my admiration<br />
          for you. This Rose Day, I pray to God that the thorns<br /> 
          on your life's path be vanished and it is filled with the<br />
          beautiful petals of love, blessings and friendship. When<br />
          I looked at the red roses and you, I found that you are<br />
          the most beautiful creation of God.Thank you for being<br />
          my source of love and inspiration. Our journey together<br />
          is as sweet as the fragrance of roses. Happy Rose Day,<br />
          my love. Please accept the rose of petals with unlimited<br />
          happiness and never ending loveðŸ¥°.
